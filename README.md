## Usage
For this Web Application, the webpage offers two options for the user and is further assisted with a text box indiciting the two options the user has. The first option is to choose form the pre-selected list of major cities for fast access. The next is the option to use the input text box and indicate which city they would like to get a weather forecast of. Once the city is clicked or input city is submited, event listeners will appropriately trigger the folling functions necessary to diplay the current weather and 5 day forecast for the city of choice selected by the user.
